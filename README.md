1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for House Price Estimation:
Data Preparation:
Load the house price dataset and inspect its structure.
Identify features (attributes) and the target variable (house prices).

Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values, if any.
Encode categorical variables and scale numerical features, especially if they have different scales.

Train-Test Split:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

KNN Model Training:
Implement and train a KNN regression model using the training set.
Experiment with different values of k and choose the one that provides the best performance (e.g., using cross-validation).

Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Insight and Observation:
Analyze the features that contribute the most to the house price predictions.
Identify any non-linear relationships or patterns that the KNN model captures.

2. Clustering for Insight using K-Means:


Choose relevant features for clustering (could include location, size, amenities, etc.).

Normalization/Scaling:
Normalize or scale the selected features.

Determine Number of Clusters (k):
Experiment with different values of k to find an optimal number of clusters. Techniques like the elbow method or silhouette score can help.
I used the elbow method so as to find best value of k(clusters)

Apply K-Means Clustering:
Use the chosen k to apply k-means clustering on the dataset.

Cluster Analysis:
Analyze the characteristics of each cluster.
Identify common features within each cluster.
Insight and Observation:

Gain insights into factors associated with houses of similar prices based on the clusters.
Understand if certain clusters represent houses in specific locations, sizes, or with particular amenities.

Correlation between KNN and Clustering Results:
Compare the insights gained from KNN predictions and clustering. Are there common patterns or features that both methods highlight?

Predicted House Price Trends:
Summarize the predicted trends in house prices based on the KNN model.
Discuss how clustering provides additional insights into the factors associated with houses of similar prices.

Recommendations:
Provide recommendations or actions based on the observed trends. For example, if certain features consistently influence house prices, this information can be valuable for real estate stakeholders.

Limitations and Future Work:
Discuss any limitations of the analysis.
Suggest areas for future exploration or improvement.
By combining KNN for regression and k-means clustering, you can gain a comprehensive understanding of house price trends and the factors that contribute to houses being grouped together. This integrated approach helps provide richer insights for decision-making in the real estate domain.
